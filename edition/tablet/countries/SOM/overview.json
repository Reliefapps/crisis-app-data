The drought is causing significant loss of livelihoods across the country, and widespread displacement. Famine is possible in 2017 if humanitarian assistance is inadequate.&nbsp;Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly&nbsp;inaccessible. The government&#39;s control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. Widespread corruption, elections (September 2016-February 2017) and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of south central Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland. The INFORM index score for risk of humanitarian&nbsp;catastrophe ranks Somalia&nbsp;at&nbsp;9.2&nbsp;out of 10, the highest&nbsp;of any country.<br />&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>16/04</strong>: 4,500 suspected cases of measles in Somalia since the start of 2017, with 88% of cases in Banadir, Galgudud, Hirshabelle, and Somaliland.<a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-drought-response-situation-report-no-4-16-april-2017\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 16/04/2017\">?</a></p><p><strong>16/04</strong>:&nbsp;25,424 cases of cholera have been reported since the beginning&nbsp;2017, more cases than the whole of 2016.?</p><p><strong>07/04:</strong>&nbsp;More than 3,000 people are displaced daily in March due to drought, bringing the total displaced since November 2016 to 571,000.<a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-drought-response-situation-report-no-4-16-april-2017\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UNHCR 07/04/2017\">?</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
