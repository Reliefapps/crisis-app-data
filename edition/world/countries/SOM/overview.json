The drought is causing significant loss of livelihoods across the country, and widespread displacement. Famine is possible in 2017 if humanitarian assistance is inadequate.&nbsp;Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly&nbsp;inaccessible. The government&#39;s control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. Widespread corruption, elections (September 2016-February 2017) and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of south central Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland. The INFORM index score for risk of humanitarian&nbsp;catastrophe ranks Somalia&nbsp;at&nbsp;9.2&nbsp;out of 10, the highest&nbsp;of any country.<br />&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>22/03:&nbsp;</strong>Over 25 people have died to starvation in March throughout Somaliland and between 65 and 80% of livestock have been killed due to prolonged drought.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20170322120943-rf6g0/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reuters 22/03/2017\">?</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-somaliland-drought-hunger/3777227.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"VOA 22/03/2017\">?</a></p><p><strong>14/03: </strong>1.2 million people are estimated to be in need of shelter assistance, up from approximately 900,000 estimated previously. <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-dashboard-february-2017-issued-14-march-2017\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 14/03/2017\">?</a>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>28/02: </strong>10,571 cases of cholera and 269 deaths have been reported since January 2017.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Somalia_OL_02_2016_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FEWSNET 28/02/2017\">?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
