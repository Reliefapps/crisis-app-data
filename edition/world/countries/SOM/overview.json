Drought has affected food and water supplies, leading to a major food security and nutrition crisis as well as a widespread measles and cholera outbreaks&nbsp;across the country. Some 600,000 people have been displaced due to drought &nbsp;between November 2016 and mid-April 2017, with most joining existing IDP camps.
