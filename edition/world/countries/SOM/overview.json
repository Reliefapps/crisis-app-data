The drought is causing significant loss of livelihoods across the country, and widespread displacement. Famine is possible in 2017 if humanitarian assistance is inadequate.&nbsp;Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly&nbsp;inaccessible. The government&#39;s control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. Widespread corruption, elections (September 2016-February 2017) and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of south central Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland.
