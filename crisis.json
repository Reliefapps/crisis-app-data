The security environment is highly volatile and has deteriorated since the withdrawal of most international forces at the end of 2014. Between January 2009 and 30 June 2016, a total of 63,934 casualties were recorded, including 22,941 deaths and 40,993 injures. The Taliban increased their influence throughout 2015 – including attacks on provincial capitals towards the end of the year – and have continued this trend in the first months of 2016. Islamic State (IS) presence has been growing in the east, with significant activity reported in Nangarhar. Increased insecurity and economic challenges caused a significant increase in the outflow of people from Afghanistan throughout 2015, despite calls from the government to stay and contribute to reconstruction of the country. The outflow continued in the first months of 2016.\n\nAbuses against Afghans in Pakistan appear to have worsened substantially since June. This has resulted in a mass influx of Afghans from Pakistan back into Afghanistan, putting a strain on the resources and coping capacity of the Afghan government and humanitarian organisations.","date":"2016-09-28T03:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"http://www.acaps.org/country/afghanistan"},"appeals":[{"source":"FTS","id":1131,"year":2016,"name":"Afghanistan 2016","type":"HRP","received":154764062,"required":338833024,"percentage":45},{"source":"FTS","id":2882,"year":2016,"name":"Afghanistan Flash Appeal: One million people on the move (September - December 2016)","type":"FLASH","received":0,"required":152100000,"percentage":0}],"figures":[{"name":"People in Need","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"8100000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1330496","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1330496","values":[{"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"8100000"},{"date":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","value":"7400000"},{"date":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","value":"9000000"}]},{"name":"People Targeted for Assistance","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"3500000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1330496","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1330496","values":[{"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"3500000"},{"date":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","value":"3800000"},{"date":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","value":"5000000"}]},{"name":"Civilians Killed or Injured","date":"2016-07-25T00:00:00Z","value":"5166 ","source":"UNAMA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1622951","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1622951","values":[{"date":"2016-07-25T00:00:00Z","value":"5166 "},{"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"11002"},{"date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"10548"}]},{"name":"Conflict-Induced Displacements","date":"2016-09-18T00:00:00Z","value":"271584","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1708991","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1708991","values":[{"date":"2016-09-18T00:00:00Z","value":"271584"},{"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"335409"}]},{"name":"Afghan Refugees in the Region","date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2551100","source":"UNHCR","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1575096","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1575096","values":[{"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2551100"},{"date":"2014-12-31 T00:00:00Z","value":"2450000 "},{"date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2457400"},{"date":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2508200"},{"date":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2540500"},{"date":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2900000"}]}]},{"index":1,"name":"Cameroon","iso3":"CMR","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/cmr","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/cmr.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/cmr.png","overview":{"text":"Some 2.7 million people, almost 10% of the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, primarily in Far North, North, Adamaoua, and East regions.

Vulnerability as well as lack of coping capacity are of particular concern, at alarming rates of 7.4/10 and 9/10.","date":"2016-09-27T09:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"http://www.acaps.org/country/chad"},"appeals":[{"source":"FTS","id":1139,"year":2016,"name":"Central African Republic Regional Refugee Response Plan 2016 (Cameroon, Chad, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo)","type":"RRP Detail","received":78469468,"required":345705555,"percentage":22},{"source":"FTS","id":1108,"year":2016,"name":"Chad 2016","type":"HRP","received":170661943,"required":541328374,"percentage":31},{"source":"FTS","id":1138,"year":2016,"name":"Nigeria Regional Refugee Response Plan 2016 (Cameroon, Chad, Niger)","type":"RRP Detail","received":48087662,"required":198764278,"percentage":24}],"figures":[{"name":"People in Need","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"2300000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1357826","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1357826","values":[{"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"2300000"},{"date":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","value":"3000000"},{"date":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"3200000"},{"date":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","value":"2870000"},{"date":"2013-07-04T00:00:00Z","value":"4700000"},{"date":"2012-12-10T00:00:00Z","value":"4400000"},{"date":"2011-12-07T00:00:00Z","value":"3811000"}]},{"name":"People Targeted for Assistance","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"1800000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1357826","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1357826","values":[{"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","value":"1800000"},{"date":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","value":"2500000"},{"date":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"2100000"},{"date":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","value":"2100000"},{"date":"2013-07-04T00:00:00Z","value":"4200000"},{"date":"2012-12-10T00:00:00Z","value":"3800000"},{"date":"2012-07-13T00:00:00Z","value":"5480000"},{"date":"2011-12-07T00:00:00Z","value":"3811000"},{"date":"2011-07-14T00:00:00Z","value":"3882568"}]},{"name":"Refugees","date":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","value":"388000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1683251","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1683251","values":[{"date":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","value":"388000"},{"date":"2016-06-27T00:00:00Z","value":"382000"},{"date":"2016-03-09T00:00:00Z","value":"374000"},{"date":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"435000"},{"date":"2015-02-10T00:00:00Z","value":"515000"},{"date":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","value":"459000"},{"date":"2014-05-14T00:00:00Z","value":"466850"},{"date":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","value":"467000"}]},{"name":"IDPs","date":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"109605","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1701621","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1701621","values":[{"date":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"109605"},{"date":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","value":"106177"},{"date":"2016-06-14T00:00:00Z","value":"102639"},{"date":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","value":"89000"},{"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"53593"},{"date":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","value":"92000"},{"date":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","value":"52396"},{"date":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","value":"82162"}]},{"name":"Severely Food Insecure People","date":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","value":"1000000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1683251","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1683251","values":[{"date":"2016-08-30T00:00:00Z","value":"1000000"},{"date":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","value":"320000"},{"date":"2016-03-09T00:00:00Z","value":"663000"},{"date":"2015-09-17T00:00:00Z","value":"403000"}]},{"name":"Children under 5 with Severe Acute Malnutrition","date":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"193943","source":"UNICEF","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1710156","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1710156","values":[{"date":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","value":"147000"},{"date":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","value":"193943"},{"date":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","value":"176900"},{"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","value":"154400"},{"date":"2015-05-30T00:00:00Z","value":"111165"},{"date":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","value":"135533"}]}]},{"index":4,"name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","iso3":"COD","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/cod","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/cod.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/cod.png","overview":{"text":"A complex emergency has persisted in DRC for more than 20 years. Conflict between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, mainly impacting the eastern provinces, has left the country in a state of prolonged, severe humanitarian crisis. Although the security situation has improved slightly since 2013, when the government defeated M23 in Nord-Kivu, humanitarian needs remain and conflict continues to cause displacement. Clashes between armed groups and the DRC armed forces are affecting populations mainly in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Health is a priority due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high because of serious human rights violations perpetrated by armed groups and the military in the eastern provinces. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country.\nThe ruling coalition is attempting to prolong President Joseph Kabila’s time in office beyond November 2016, when his constitutional two-term limit is due to end. Since the beginning of the year, election-related violence has increased. Protests related to the forthcoming presidential elections have taken place in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Bukavu, and Goma. Election-related human rights violations, and restrictions on freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly, have been reported since 2015.\nINFORM measures DRC's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.9/10.

spread across eastern and northern South Sudan in December 2013 after President Kiir accused Vice President Riek Machar of plotting a coup against him. The conflict has become increasingly intercommunal in nature, with the Dinka allied to President Kiir, and the Nuer loosely allied with Vice President Riek Machar. A ceasefire agreement was signed in August 2015, and a transitional government was created in April 2016. Clashes between government forces and opposition groups, however, have continued. A growing number of active armed groups are appearing that are not party to the peace agreement. \n\nThe conflict has mostly been concentrated in Jonglei, Upper Nile, and Unity states, spreading to Western Equatoria in November 2015. Since February, however, these areas have been relatively calm, while fighting has significantly escalated in Western Bahr el Ghazal. In early July in Juba, forces loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with those loyal to Reik Machar, echoing events that triggered the conflict in 2013 and raising concerns of a return to full-scale civil war.\nFood insecurity and malnutrition rates are unprecedented, and insecurity is hampering the delivery of assistance. The UN reports widespread violation of human rights and targeted violence against civilians.\nINFORM measures South Sudan's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be extremely high, at 8.3/10.
