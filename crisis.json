With the increase in the number of people internally displaced by conflict and the influx of returnees, shelter and WASH needs have increased significantly. 9.3 million people are reported in need of humanitarian assistance. However, the high level of insecurity constrains access.\nThe Taliban increased their influence throughout 2015 – including attacks on provincial capitals towards the end of the year – and this has continued in 2016. The Islamic State (IS) presence has been growing in the east, with significant activity reported in Nangarhar. \nAbuses against Afghans in Pakistan appear to have worsened substantially since June. This has resulted in a mass influx of Afghans from Pakistan back into Afghanistan, putting a strain on the resources and coping capacity of the Afghan government and humanitarian organisations. At the same time, thousands of Afghans are returning from Iran either spontaneously or through deportation, adding to the numbers of internally displaced and people in need in Afghanistan. In the coming months thousands of Afghan asylum seekers are expected to return as a result of a deal between the European Union and the Afghan government.\nINFORM measures Afghanistan’s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7.8/10.

complex emergency has persisted in DRC for more than 20 years. Conflict between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, mainly impacting the eastern provinces, has left the country in a state of prolonged, severe humanitarian crisis. Although the security situation has improved slightly since 2013, when the government defeated M23 in Nord-Kivu, humanitarian needs remain and conflict continues to cause displacement. Clashes between armed groups and the DRC armed forces are affecting populations mainly in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Health is a priority due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high because of serious human rights violations perpetrated by armed groups and the military in the eastern provinces. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country.\nThe ruling coalition is attempting to prolong President Joseph Kabila’s time in office beyond November 2016, when his constitutional two-term limit is due to end. Since the beginning of the year, election-related violence has increased. Protests related to the forthcoming presidential elections have taken place in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Bukavu, and Goma. Election-related human rights violations, and restrictions on freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly, have been reported since 2015.\nINFORM measures DRC's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.9/10.

persists in Mali, although progress towards the establishment of interim authorities in the north was made between armed groups in late October. Tension still remains between the CMA and the GATIA, signatories of the peace deal signed in 2015, who clashed numerous times in Kidal between July and September. An increase in attacks from Islamist armed groups has been reported at the beginning of November. \nOverall, a lack of access to basic social services and the low capacity of public administration drives humanitarian needs. While IDPs and refugees have slowly been returning home since 2013, over 33,000 people remain internally displaced and around 136,000 refugees are still in neighbouring countries. \nINFORM measures Mali's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.6/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at alarming levels, at 6.2/10, 6.8/10 and 6.7/10 respectively.","date":"2016-11-29T10:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/mali"},"appeals":[{"source":"FTS","id":1110,"year":2016,"name":"Mali 2016","type":"HRP","received":131231557,"required":354052695,"percentage":37}],"figures":[{"name":"People in Need","date":"2016-12-05T12:00:00Z","value":"3700000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1804974","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1804974","values":[{"date":"2016-12-05T12:00:00Z","value":"3700000"},{"date":"2016-01-01T12:00:00Z","value":"2500000"},{"date":"2015-01-01T12:00:00Z","value":"2640000"}]},{"name":"People Targeted for Assistance","date":"2016-12-05T12:00:00Z","value":"1400000","source":"OCHA","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1804974","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1804974","values":[{"date":"2016-12-05T12:00:00Z","value":"1400000"},{"date":"2016-01-01T12:00:00Z","value":"1000000"},{"date":"2015-01-01T12:00:00Z","value":"1550000"}]},{"name":"Malian Refugees in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger","date":"2016-10-31T12:00:00Z","value":"135954","source":"UNHCR","url":"http://data.unhcr.org/SahelSituation/country.php?id=501","link":"http://data.unhcr.org/SahelSituation/country.php?id=501","values":[{"date":"2016-10-31T12:00:00Z","value":"135954"},{"date":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"134814"},{"date":"2016-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"134811"},{"date":"2016-05-31T12:00:00Z","value":"134262"},{"date":"2016-01-31T12:00:00Z","value":"143006"},{"date":"2015-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"137336"},{"date":"2015-05-31T12:00:00Z","value":"134153"},{"date":"2015-01-31T12:00:00Z","value":"129945"},{"date":"2014-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"137741"},{"date":"2014-05-31T12:00:00Z","value":"129556"},{"date":"2013-12-31T12:00:00Z","value":"152038"},{"date":"2013-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"153522"},{"date":"2013-04-29T12:00:00Z","value":"146230"},{"date":"2012-12-31T12:00:00Z","value":"95346"},{"date":"2012-08-27T12:00:00Z","value":"146783"},{"date":"2012-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"67127"}]},{"name":"Malian Refugee Returnees","date":"2016-10-31T12:00:00Z","value":"24934","source":"UNHCR","url":"http://data.unhcr.org/SahelSituation/country.php?id=501","link":"http://data.unhcr.org/SahelSituation/country.php?id=501","values":[{"date":"2016-10-31T12:00:00Z","value":"24934"},{"date":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"24926"},{"date":"2016-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"24843"},{"date":"2016-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"21274"},{"date":"2015-12-31T12:00:00Z","value":"17534"},{"date":"2015-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"16614"},{"date":"2015-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"16218"},{"date":"2014-12-31T12:00:00Z","value":"15003"},{"date":"2014-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"12892"},{"date":"2014-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"12131"},{"date":"2014-01-22T12:00:00Z","value":"9339"}]},{"name":"IDPs","date":"2016-08-04T12:00:00Z","value":"39182","source":"IOM","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1642311","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1642311","values":[{"date":"2016-08-04T12:00:00Z","value":"39182"},{"date":"2016-05-31T12:00:00Z","value":"37561"},{"date":"2016-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"36762"},{"date":"2016-02-24T12:00:00Z","value":"52163"},{"date":"2015-06-02T12:00:00Z","value":"102346"},{"date":"2015-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"43101"},{"date":"2014-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"101279"},{"date":"2014-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"137096"}]},{"name":"People Assisted with WFP Food Aid (per month)","date":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"378681","source":"WFP","url":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1795689","link":"http://m.reliefweb.int/report/1795689","values":[{"date":"2019-07-31T12:00:00Z","value":"365700"},{"date":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"378681"},{"date":"2016-08-31T12:00:00Z","value":"403900"},{"date":"2016-06-30T12:00:00Z","value":"541000"},{"date":"2016-05-31T12:00:00Z","value":"474700"},{"date":"2016-04-30T12:00:00Z","value":"404900"},{"date":"2016-03-31T12:00:00Z","value":"378100"},{"date":"2016-02-29T12:00:00Z","value":"346700"},{"date":"2016-01-31T12:00:00Z","value":"322800"},{"date":"2015-12-31T12:00:00Z","value":"359500"},{"date":"2015-11-30T12:00:00Z","value":"383300"},{"date":"2015-10-31T12:00:00Z","value":"416800"},{"date":"2015-09-30T12:00:00Z","value":"499700"}]}]},{"index":9,"name":"Myanmar","iso3":"MMR","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/mmr","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/mmr.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/mmr.png","overview":{"text":"Protracted armed conflict between ethnic groups and the government means 500,000 people are in continued need of assistance.

ceasefire has not halted fighting that first escalated in Yemen in March 2015, and 18.8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, including 10.3 million people in acute need. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) declared Yemen a Level 3 emergency in July 2015.\nAn armed advance on the capital by Houthis from the north has led to civil war throughout the country. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has supported the Yemeni government with airstrikes since March 2015. Activities by southern secessionists Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State (IS) compound the security and political challenges.\nINFORM measures Yemen's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster at a very high level of 7.5/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at alarming levels: 8.1/10, 7.9/10 and 6.5/10
